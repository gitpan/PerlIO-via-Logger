Revision history for PerlIO-via-Logger

0.03    Feb 8, 2007
	- Corrected bug in test file that would occur during the first 9 days
	of each month.  During the 1st-9th localtime(time) returns days with
	a leading zero.  The 0 is then stripped out (correctly) by my test
	formatting string of "%d" resulting in a string mismatch later.
	The new format is "%02d" and localtime(time) is run though sprintf
	just in case.
	- Corrected trivial Pod tag that was causing failures for 3 CPAN testers

0.02    Jan 24, 2007
	- Stripped out funky code form logify. It now uses binmode() to insert
  	the layer gracefully... sans funk.
	- Clarified a few points of the POD

0.01    Jan 24, 2007
        - Initial version, released on an unsuspecting world. Muhaha.
